## Instructions

Thanks for using `p-s`! I'm glad/I hope it's been helpful to you. Please add a link to your example here. If you're
adding a GitHub link, please make sure you hard-link so future changes in your codebase don't break the link. The
keyboard shortcut for this is `y`.

[Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/kentcdodds/p-s/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and add yourself as a
